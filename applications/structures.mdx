description: How to use Osprey monitoring systems on structural assets such as bridges, buildings, and civil infrastructure.

## Overview

Structural assets such as bridges, buildings, towers, and civil infrastructure demand continuous insight into how they behave under real loading and environmental conditions. This page outlines typical monitoring objectives for structures and how Osprey systems can be combined to deliver actionable data streams for design validation, condition assessment, and long-term risk management.

## Common monitoring goals

- Track long-term deformation, settlement, and tilt to identify emerging structural issues.
- Measure dynamic response to traffic, wind, or seismic excitation for modal analysis.
- Correlate load, displacement, and temperature to validate design assumptions.
- Detect changes in stiffness or damping that may indicate damage or degradation.
- Monitor critical connections, bearings, and joints for abnormal movement.
- Provide automated alerts when key thresholds are exceeded.
- Supply evidence for maintenance planning, life-extension decisions, and regulatory reporting.
