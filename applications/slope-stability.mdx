title: Slope Stability
description: How to use Osprey instrumentation to monitor slope stability, deformation, and settlement.
---

## Overview

Slope stability monitoring helps you understand how natural and engineered slopes respond over time, so you can identify movement trends and respond before they affect safety or operations. This guide outlines common monitoring goals and shows how Osprey products can be combined to track rotation, settlement, and displacement along slopes, embankments, and cuttings.

## Common monitoring goals

- Track rotation and shear within soil or rock to identify developing slip surfaces.
- Measure settlement and heave along the slope crest, toe, or benches.
- Monitor displacement at key structural elements such as retaining walls, piles, or anchors.
- Correlate movement with construction stages, rainfall, reservoir level, or traffic loading.
- Build deformation profiles along critical sections to support stability analysis.
- Provide continuous data streams suitable for alarm thresholds and trend reporting.
