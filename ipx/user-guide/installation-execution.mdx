## Installation Execution

### Standard Installation Procedure

1. **Position Equipment**
   - Position the coiled support rod and braked reel beside the magnetic extensometer installation

2. **Attach Bottom Support**
   - Place the bottom support on the end of the support rod
   - Tighten both grub screws hand tight (0.5Nm)

3. **Begin Installation**
   - Roll out enough support rod such that the bottom support can be lowered straight into the access tube
   - Feed in the support rod until you reach the first magnet position

4. **Secure Rod**
   - Use a hand clamp to prevent the rod sliding further into the access tube

5. **Install First IPX**
   - Slide the IPX onto the support rod
   - Line the magnet position marking on the rod with the markers on the underside of the IPX
   - Allow for expected movement of the magnet (see Planning section)

6. **Secure IPX to Rod**
   - While pressing the rod into the hollow just above the lower end piece assembly, tighten the two lower grub screws hand tight (0.5Nm)
   - Pressing the rod into the IPX hollow all the way up the device, tighten the two upper grub screws hand tight

7. **Lower Into Tube**
   - Remove the hand clamp
   - Slide the IPX and rod into the access tube
   - Secure the cable at regular intervals using cable ties

8. **Position for Next IPX**
   - When you reach the next IPX position, use the hand clamp to secure the rod 1m below the IPX position

9. **Install Subsequent IPXs**
   - Follow steps 5 and 6 to secure the IPX to the support rod
   - Remove cable slack by doubling the cable back on itself and securing to the support rod using cable ties

<Callout kind="alert" title="Cable Management">
  Do not use electrical tape as that will lose adhesion when wet. Use cable ties only.
</Callout>

10. **Repeat Process**
    - Repeat steps 7-9 until you have installed the final IPX

11. **Lower to Final Position**
    - Lower the rod and sensors into the access tube
    - **For bottom supported installations:** Lower until the bottom support is resting on the bottom of the access tube
    - **For top supported installations:** Lower until the sensors are at their intended depths

12. **Install Top Support**
    - Slide the top support over the support rod and into the access tube
    - Mark the support rod at the point where it exits the top support
    - Pull the support rod up by 300mm and use the hand clamp to secure it

13. **Cut Rod to Length**
    - Use a hand saw to cut the support rod 50mm above the top support marking
    - Use a file to remove any burrs or splinters
    - A rubber cap may be used to protect the end

14. **Secure Top Support**
    - Position the top support on the rod
    - Tighten both grub screws hand tight

<Callout kind="alert" title="Bottom Supported Exception">
  For bottom supported installations where telescoping sections have been used, or where the magnetic extensometer has been installed using a stiff grout, do not tighten the top support grub screws.
</Callout>

15. **Final Positioning**
    - Lower the assembly back into the hole
    - In bottom supported installations, the top support should not be supporting any weight

## Extending Through Fill

Where an embankment is being raised and the extensometer extended, the IPX can be extended without interfering with an existing bottom supported IPX installation.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Recommendation">
  It is highly recommended that if an installation extension is expected, a bottom supported configuration is used.
</Callout>

### Important Notes

1. **Bottom Supported Only**
   - Extension of the IPX in-situ should only be performed on bottom supported installations

2. **Height Limitations**
   - The inclusion of an IPX in an extended section will add weight to the extended section and decrease lateral stability
   - Extensions of more than 2m above fill level are not recommended

3. **Telescoping Section Compatibility**
   - Telescoping sections may result in a larger diameter collar at the top of the access tube and may not be compatible with the standard top support
   - In these instances, it is recommended a temporary section of standard access tubing be installed within the telescoping section to allow the support rod to be secured and centralized

### Cabling for Extensions

As described in the Building the String section, sufficient cable should have been added to the current top sensor to reach the newly installed IPX.

<Callout kind="info" title="On-Site Connections">
  Cable connection to the IPX generally requires a heat gun or butane torch. This can be challenging or outright prohibited on site. It is therefore suggested that in-line connectors are used to allow quick and reliable connection/disconnection of instruments on site.
</Callout>

IPXs can be supplied with connectors attached on request, or users can splice OMS supplied connectors onto their IPXs in the workshop prior to mobilization to site.

### Extension - Preparation

1. Calculate the length of rod required and position of the IPX along the new section of rod
2. Cut the rod to length and mark the IPX position using a marker pen
3. Slide the IPX over the new section of GRP rod ensuring the rod is firmly pressed into the recess and secure by tightening the grub screws
4. Place the GRP rod coupling on the end of the new support rod, ensuring the rod ends mid-way through the coupling, and secure using the grub screws, tightened hand tight (0.5Nm)
5. Slide the cable, rod and IPX through the new section of access tube

### Extension - Installation

1. **Disconnect Existing Installation**
   - Disconnect the existing IPX installation from the data logger
   - Prepare the cable for the extension – either cut to length and strip the end, or by disconnecting the top cable connector

2. **Remove Top Support**
   - Remove the IPX top support

3. **Install Access Tube Coupling (if applicable)**
   - If a coupling is to be used to join the new access tube, affix it in place in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines

4. **Position New Section**
   - Position the new section of access tube/rod/and IPX assembly over the installed extensometer

5. **Connect Rod Sections**
   - Place the GRP rod coupling onto the top of the installed GRP rod and tighten both grub screws

6. **Connect Cable**
   - Perform the cable connection, whether by splicing, or joining the connectors

7. **Join Access Tubes**
   - Join the new access tube extension onto the installed access tube in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines

8. **Test System**
   - Reconnect the top IPX to the data logger
   - Update with new addresses and test to confirm results from all sensors on the string

<Callout kind="tip" title="Post-Installation Verification">
  Always test all sensors in the string after extension to ensure proper communication and measurement accuracy.
