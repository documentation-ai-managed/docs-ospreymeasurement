## In-Place Inclinometer Carriages

This section provides detailed instructions for installing OTS sensors in inclinometer casings.

### Equipment and Materials

Before beginning installation, ensure you have the following:

- Osprey in-place inclinometer string supplied preassembled on a reel
- Reel mount (supplied or equivalent suitable support)
- Inclinometer casing with correctly aligned grooves
- String support T-bar (where multiple string sections are supplied)
- Nylock nut and nut spinner (where applicable)
- Cable ties for cable management
- Wire rope for base support and emergency retrieval
- Compatible digital data logger

### Installation Method

Follow these steps carefully to ensure proper installation:

#### Step 1: Mount the Reel

Mount the inclinometer reel securely on the supplied reel mount or an equivalent support.

#### Step 2: Position the Reel

Position the reel adjacent to the borehole to allow controlled unspooling of the inclinometer string.

#### Step 3: Verify Wheel Orientation

Verify that the fixed wheel on each carriage is oriented in the direction of expected ground movement.

  Correct wheel orientation is essential for accurate measurements.
</Callout>

#### Step 4: Secure Wire Rope

Secure a wire rope to the bottom sensor prior to installation to provide base support and emergency retrieval.

#### Step 5: Align First Sensor

Align the first sensor with the inclinometer casing grooves.

#### Step 6: Insert First Carriage

Compress the sprung wheel and insert the first carriage into the casing.

#### Step 7: Lower the String

Lower the string slowly until the next wheeled carriage reaches the casing entrance.

#### Step 8: Insert Remaining Carriages

Compress the sprung wheel of each carriage in turn and insert into the casing.

<Callout kind="alert" title="Verification">
  Confirm that both wheels are firmly seated within the casing grooves before proceeding.
</Callout>

#### Step 9: Continue Lowering

Continue lowering the string progressively until all sensors are installed.

#### Step 10: Support Multiple Sections (if applicable)

Where supplied in multiple sections, support the installed section using the support T-bar.

#### Step 11: Connect Sections

Connect subsequent sections using the supplied lock nut and nut spinner.

#### Step 12: Cable Management

Use cable ties to manage signal cables and prevent snagging during installation.

#### Step 13: Final Positioning

Secure the final sensor to the top support and lower into its final position.

### Cable Identification and Connections

Ensure all signal cables are clearly identified. 

<Callout kind="alert" title="Important">
  If cables are cut, they must be correctly remarked prior to termination.
</Callout>

### Testing and Verification

Proper testing is crucial to ensure system integrity:

#### Pre-Installation Testing

Test all sensors directly prior to installation to confirm correct operation.

#### Post-Installation Testing

Test all sensors immediately after installation to verify integrity and correct operation.

#### Fault Rectification

Rectify any faults identified before the system is commissioned.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Best Practice">
  Document sensor readings before and after installation to establish baseline values and confirm proper operation.
</Callout>
