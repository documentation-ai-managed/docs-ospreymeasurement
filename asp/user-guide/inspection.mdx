title: Inspection on Arrival
description: Physical and operational checks to perform upon receiving your ASP system
---

## Overview

The ASP arrives in a coil of roughly 700mm ID. It is important to perform a physical inspection and a function check on arrival to confirm no damage has been sustained during shipping.

## Physical Check

Perform the following visual inspections:

### Fluid Integrity

Check for any sign of fluid egress at both of the end caps, particularly at:
- Cable entry site
- Around the rim of the collars

### Hose Condition

Check for abrasion to the MDPE hose around the edges.

<Callout kind="info" title="Minor Abrasions">
  The MDPE is robust and able to sustain minor abrasions without impacting the performance of the system, but any gouges deeper than 1mm should be reported to Osprey before deploying to site.
</Callout>

### Cable Inspection

Inspect the cable for:
- Abrasion
- Crushing
- Kinking

## Operation Check

### Functional Testing

Follow these steps to verify proper operation:

1. **Connect to Data Logger**
   - Link the ASP to your preferred data logger or the Serial USB Terminal app
   - Carry out a read cycle and confirm all sensors are reporting correctly

2. **Elevation Change Test**
   - Raise the cable end of the ASP by a known amount
   - Repeat the read cycle
   - Confirm that the value has increased for the other sensors by the expected amount

<Callout kind="tip" title="Best Practice">
  Document the baseline readings during this operation check for future reference and troubleshooting.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="alert" title="Report Any Issues">
  If any damage or operational issues are identified during inspection, contact Osprey Measurement Systems before proceeding to site installation.
</Callout>
