## Overview

The ASP arrives fully filled, de-aired and sealed, removing any necessity for on-site hydraulic connections, deairing, filling or flushing.

<Callout kind="info" title="Handling Considerations">
  Depending on length, the ASP can become quite heavy, and a cable dispenser is recommended for safely installing the ASP in a controlled manner.
</Callout>

## Reference Pad

As described in the Planning section, establishing a datum is essential to the performance of the ASP on your project. Even when based outside of the zone of influence, there should be a means of verifying the elevation of the reference sensor.

To create a rigid mechanical connection between the ASP reference sensor and the benchmark, a small concrete pad is poured within the trench at the reference location. The ASP reference sensor and the validation benchmark or reference instrument (secondary ASP, IPX, GNSS node) are fixed to the same concrete pad for confident transfer of control from one system to the other.

### Reference Pad Installation Procedure

1. **Prepare Formwork**
   - Place formwork in a trench at the reference location
   - Create a concrete pad at least **500 x 500 x 200mm**
   - The top of the formwork should be level with the intended alignment of the ASP

2. **Ground Support (Soft Ground Only)**
   - In very soft ground, drive four star-pickets into the ground
   - Ensure they finish just below the top of the concrete pad

3. **IPX Isolation (If Applicable)**
   - If the reference pad is being installed around an IPX
   - Use a section of PVC pipe to isolate the access tube from the concrete prior to pouring

4. **Pour and Set Concrete**
   - Pour concrete and screed level
   - Once the concrete is set, install a settlement point socket in the concrete offset slightly from the centre

5. **Install ASP**
   - Install the ASP as detailed in the installation methods below
   - Affix the reference end of the ASP to the concrete pad using the ASP fixing bracket

### Reference Pad – Survey Reference

Used when the reference datum comes from survey measurements taken at the settlement point socket on the reference pad.

### Reference Pad – Extensometer Reference

Used when the reference datum is derived from an In-Place Extensometer (IPX) installed through the reference pad.

### Reference Pad – ASP Reference

Where reference is taken from one ASP to another:

  Use two or more sturdy zip ties to bind the systems such that the final sensor of one and the reference sensor of the other are aligned.

## Installation Methods

### Sand Filled Trench

This method provides optimal protection for the ASP in environments with large aggregate or debris.

1. **Excavate Trench**
   - Minimum **800mm deep x 500-1000mm wide**
   - Ensure the base of the trench is even and any slopes are gradual

2. **Prepare Base**
   - Line the trench with a suitable geotextile
   - Lay **300mm** compacted sand/stone free clean fill on the bottom of the trench

3. **Position ASP**
   - Lay the ASP along the centreline of the trench on top of the compacted sand/clean fill
   - Coil excess length on top of the reference pad and bundle with cable ties
   - Fix the reference sensor to the reference pad using the ASP fixing bracket

4. **Connect Data Cable**
   - Run the data cable through a flexible conduit to the data logger location
   - Connect to the data logger

5. **Function Test**
   - Test the ASP for functionality to ensure no damage has occurred during installation

6. **Survey and Record**
   - Have a surveyor record the position of the ASP reference point
   - Record positions at intervals along the length of the ASP at each node position

7. **Cover ASP**
   - Lay another **300mm** of compacted sand/fill on top of the ASP
   - Wrap the geotextile over the top of the trench, one side overlapping the other
   - Form a continuous, enclosed, sand-filled cylinder the length of the trench

8. **Warning Tape**
   - Lay detectable underground warning tape along the length of the trench
   - Position directly above the alignment of the ASP

9. **Backfill**
   - Place a layer of general site fill to fill the remaining depth of the trench
   - Ensure at least **200mm depth** once compacted

10. **Post-Installation Checks**
    - Conduct another function check to ensure no damage has occurred during backfilling
    - Bury the reference pad and sensor, ensuring the settlement point is easily accessible

11. **Stabilization Period**
    - Allow the system to stabilise for **24-48 hours** before taking a base reading

### Directly Buried

Where the host material is adequately stone and debris free, the ASP can be directly buried.

1. **Excavate Trench**
   - **500mm deep x 300-500mm wide**
   - Install reference pad as described above

2. **Position ASP**
   - Lay the ASP within the trench
   - Coil excess hose length on top of the reference pad and bundle with cable ties
   - Fix the reference sensor to the reference pad using the ASP fixing bracket

3. **Connect Cable**
   - Run the cable through a flexible conduit to the data logger location
   - Connect to the data logger

4. **Function Test**
   - Conduct a function check to ensure that no damage has occurred during installation

5. **Survey and Record**
   - Have a surveyor record the position of the ASP reference point
   - Record positions at intervals along the length of the ASP at each node position

6. **Backfill**
   - Backfill the trench with the excavated material
   - Compact in layers to ensure competent support all around the ASP hose
   - Ensure at least **300mm** of compacted material is covering the ASP

7. **Warning Tape**
   - Lay detectable underground warning tape along the length of the trench
   - Position directly above the alignment of the ASP

8. **Complete Backfilling**
   - Fill and compact the remaining depth of the trench with the excavated material

9. **Post-Installation Checks**
   - Conduct a function check to ensure no damage has occurred during backfilling
   - Bury the reference pad and sensor, ensuring the settlement point is easily accessible

10. **Stabilization Period**
    - Allow the system to stabilise for **24-48 hours** before taking a base reading

### Installed in Conduit

For new conduit installations, install a 70mm conduit using the same methodology laid out above for direct burial or installation within a sand filled trench.

<Callout kind="alert" title="Conduit Preparation">
  Ensure the ends of the conduit are cut to allow the ASP reference sensor to protrude from the conduit and be securely fixed to the reference pad.
</Callout>

1. **Prepare Decoiler**
   - Assemble the ASP decoiler and place at the end of the conduit
   - Place the ASP onto the decoiler and cut binding zip-ties
   - Temporarily fasten the cable and cable end of the ASP to the decoiler frame

2. **Attach Pulling Sock**
   - The ASP is supplied with a pulling sock – a stainless-steel mesh
   - Push the pulling sock over the end of the ASP all the way
   - Tug to engage

3. **Prepare Pull Cord**
   - Feed a strong paracord (min break rating 50kg) through the conduit using a fish tape or compressor
   - Attach the cord to the ASP pulling sock using a bowline knot

4. **Pull Through Conduit**
   - With one person feeding the ASP into the conduit and another gently pulling
   - Slowly feed the ASP into the conduit until in position

5. **Secure and Connect**
   - Coil excess length on top of the reference pad and bundle with cable ties
   - Fix the reference sensor to the reference pad using the ASP fixing bracket
   - Run the cable through a flexible conduit to the data logger location

6. **Function Test**
   - Conduct a function check to ensure no damage has occurred during installation

7. **Final Steps**
   - Bury the reference pad and sensor, ensuring the settlement point is easily accessible
   - Allow the system to stabilise for **24-48 hours** before taking a base reading

<Callout kind="tip" title="Installation Best Practice">
  Always conduct function tests before and after backfilling to identify and address any damage during the installation process.
