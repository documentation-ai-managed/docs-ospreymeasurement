## Overview

Osprey Measurement Systems provides advanced geotechnical and structural instrumentation for the civil and resources sectors. You get monitoring solutions that automate manual processes, reduce costs, and deliver precise data from challenging environments. Key products like the Osprey Tilt String (`OTS`) and In-Place Extensometer (`IPX`) enable distributed measurements for tilt, strain, and deformation in assets such as diaphragm walls, pipelines, railways, and retaining structures.

## Key Products

Discover the core instruments designed for robust, easy-to-deploy monitoring.

<Columns cols="3">
  <Card title="Osprey Tilt String (OTS)" href="/products/ots" icon="triangle-right" horizontal="false" target="_self">
    Provides distributed tilt measurements along vertical and linear assets. Connect up to 150 micro-tilts in a serial bus for high-precision data from a single cable. Ideal for embedding in concrete or direct burial.
  </Card>

  <Card title="In-Place Extensometer (IPX)" href="/products/ipx" icon="ruler" horizontal="false">
    Measures precise deformations and settlements in geotechnical structures. Offers reliable, long-term monitoring with minimal maintenance for boreholes and anchors.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Automatic Settlement Profiler (ASP)" href="/products/asp" icon="audio-waveform" horizontal="false" target="_self">
    Monitors differential vertical settlement across wide areas. Low cost, simple to install and ultra high accuracy regardless of distance from datum.&#x20;
