<Callout kind="alert" title="Scope">
  This user manual relates only to the installation of the Osprey Measurement Systems In-Place Extensometer. For instructions on the installation of magnetic extensometer equipment, well covers or data loggers, refer to the appropriate manufacturer's guidelines.
</Callout>

## Safety Considerations

Any activity, especially within a construction environment, carries safety risks. The risks to health, safety and environment are distinct to each application. A full site-specific risk assessment should be conducted prior to installing any Osprey Measurement Systems equipment.

**Some hazards when assembling and installing an In-Place Extensometer are:**
- Soldering
- Heat gun
- Use of hazardous substances
- Use of hand tools
- Manual handling
- Pinch points

<Callout kind="info" title="Splicing Materials">
  *Required where splicing is to be carried out. Please see Osprey document "Splicing Procedure for the IPX" for further information.
</Callout>

## Planning the Installation

Installation occurs following the successful installation and commissioning of the magnetic extensometer.

### Conduct a Manual Survey

The manual survey of the magnetic extensometer installation should use the base of the extensometer access tube as the reference.

**Survey Procedure:**
1. Lower the probe to the bottom of the access tube and note its depth
2. The offset between the tape measurements and the tip of the probe should be known
3. Retrieve the probe noting the magnetic target positions on the way up

### Top Support or Bottom Support

#### Bottom Support (Preferred Method)

Provided that the magnetic extensometer is suitably socketed into a competent foundation material such as rock or stiff clay, the IPX can be supported from the bottom.

**Advantages:**
- Not affected by stresses on the PVC access tube
- Allows for easy extension or shortening of the system without interrupting the existing sensors

#### Top Support

Top support can be used where:
- The foundation socket is not confirmed
- Applications where subsidence due to tunneling or undermining is being monitored

<Callout kind="alert" title="Top Support Considerations">
  When top support is used, this should be taken into consideration when positioning the IPX, and regular geodetic survey of the top support is required.
</Callout>

### Intended Positions for the IPX

Consideration should be given to where the sensors are to be positioned. This will vary depending on factors such as:
- Expected movement
- Whether the installation is bottom or top supported
- Whether telescoping sections are being used

#### Positioning Guidelines

| Expected Condition | Magnet Position | Goal |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Settlement Expected | Top 25% of measurable range | Allows measurement of downward movement |
| Heave Expected | Lower 25% of measurable range | Allows measurement of upward movement |
| Uncertain | Mid-way through measurement range | Allows bidirectional measurement |

<Callout kind="tip" title="Measurement Range">
  Position the magnet to maximize the available measurement range in the direction of expected movement.
</Callout>

## Preparing the Instruments

### Installation Worksheets

An interactive IPX worksheet for establishing cable lengths and IPX positions can be downloaded from the Osprey Measurement Systems support site:

[IPX Installation Worksheet](https://support.ospreymeasurement.com/portal/en/kb/articles/ipx-installation-worksheet)

### Custom String Orders

Where a pre-built string with custom lengths is required, please complete form PR-F12-IPX-Custom String Order Form, which can be downloaded from the Osprey Measurement Systems support site:

[Custom IPX Order Form](https://support.ospreymeasurement.com/portal/en/kb/articles/custom-ipx-order-form)

### Building the String

<Callout kind="info" title="Orientation">
  Note the orientation of the IPX – the Osprey logo should be at the end closest to the data logger.
</Callout>

**Procedure:**

1. Cut the cables to length
2. Strip the outer sheaths of both cables 50mm from the end and separate out the conductors
3. Using a small strip of emery paper, scuff the end 20mm of cable jacket to provide a competent bond with the adhesive heat shrink
4. Using an adjustable wire stripper, remove 10mm of sheath from each conductor
5. Slide the adhesive lined heat shrink and heavy-duty heat shrink over one of the cables – do not apply heat at this stage
6. Slide an inner heat shrink sleeve over a conductor
7. Position the corresponding conductor in line with the selected conductor and interlock the conductor strands
8. Solder the two conductors together, ensuring the heat does not impact the heat shrink sleeve
9. Slide the heat shrink sleeve over the soldered conductor strands
10. Using a heat gun or butane torch, apply heat to the sleeve, starting from the center and working your way out

<Callout kind="alert" title="Safety">
  The connector will be hot for some time – allow it to cool before continuing onto the next pair of conductors.
</Callout>

11. Repeat for each conductor
12. Test the connection following the instructions in the Initial Checks section
13. Slide the outer adhesive lined polyolefin heat shrink sleeve over the conductor connections so that they are centralized within the sleeve
14. Using a heat gun, apply heat, starting from the center and working your way out to the edges
15. Once cooled, slide the heavy duty heat shrink over, positioning it so the adhesive lined heat shrink is central, and apply heat
16. Test the connection again

Repeat the above for each IPX connection.

### Terminating the Bottom IPX

To protect the string from water ingress, the bottom IPX must be sealed.

**Procedure:**
1. Cut the cable below the bottom IPX
2. Expose each conductor
3. Individually insulate using adhesive heat shrink
4. Dip or otherwise cover the termination in waterproof compound
5. Cover the area with outer heat shrink with a section of blanking rubber cord or similar

### Setting Out the GRP Rod

1. Ensure the top end of the GRP rod and plastic coating is cut flat with any burrs or splinters removed. A rubber cap is advised to protect the end
2. Starting from the bottom and working your way up, mark each magnet position using electrical tape or a marker pen
3. Mark the expected top of the access tube for comparison on site
