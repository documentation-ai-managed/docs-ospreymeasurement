description: Monitoring considerations and relevant Osprey instrumentation for deep excavations.

## Overview

Deep excavations for basements, underground stations, and utility shafts can affect nearby ground and structures. Instrumentation helps you track excavation wall performance, support system loads, and ground movements so you can manage risk to adjacent assets and verify design assumptions.

## Common monitoring goals

Typical monitoring objectives for deep excavations include:

- Confirming lateral deflection and rotation of excavation walls
- Measuring deformation of struts, anchors, or other support elements
- Tracking vertical and horizontal ground movements around the excavation
- Observing settlement and heave beneath adjacent structures and utilities
- Providing early warning of movements that approach trigger levels
- Supporting back-analysis and refinement of geotechnical models

## Relevant Osprey products

The following Osprey systems are commonly used in deep excavation monitoring schemes.

<Card title="OTS" href="/ots/overview" icon="gauge" cta="View OTS overview">

OTS measures orientation and rotation, allowing deformation profiling along a line or curve such as a retaining wall or support element.

<Card title="ASP" href="/asp/overview" icon="droplets" cta="View ASP overview">

ASP measures distributed settlement along a nominally horizontal profile using the hydrostatic principle, suitable for tracking ground or structural settlement.
