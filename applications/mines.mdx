description: Deformation, settlement, and displacement monitoring in open-pit and underground mines using Osprey systems.
---

## Mining application overview

Mines experience continuous ground movement from excavation, backfilling, blasting, and groundwater changes. Effective monitoring helps you track deformation, settlement, and displacement around critical infrastructure and working areas in both open-pit and underground environments.

## Common monitoring goals in mines

- Measure slope deformation in open pits and waste dumps along benches, haul roads, and pit walls.
- Track vertical settlement of tailings facilities, backfill, and overburden.
- Monitor convergence and displacement along drifts, crosscuts, and access tunnels.
- Observe deformation around shafts, raises, and other vertical excavations.
- Detect differential movement near surface structures such as crushers, conveyors, and process plants within the mining area.
- Support back-analysis and model calibration with distributed deformation and settlement data along key profiles.
