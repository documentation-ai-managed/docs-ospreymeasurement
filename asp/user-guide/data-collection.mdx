description: Wiring, protocols, and data conversion formulas for ASP system communication
---

## Overview

Communication with the ASP nodes is done via an RS485 interface. This can be a serial port interface or a digital data logger.

## Wiring Guide

The ASP wiring configuration is as follows:

| Colour | Function | Connector Pin |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Red | 8-18V | 4 |
| Black | Ground (G) | 1 |
| Blue | RS485 A | 2 |
| White | RS485 B | 3 |

## Addresses

Nodes can be addressed using their Modbus alias which starts at **"1"** from the node closest to the cable entry point and are numbered sequentially along the length of the ASP.

## RS485 Protocols

### Serial Configuration

ASP nodes communicate via RS485 using the following serial settings:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Baud | 9600 |
| Data Bits | 8 |
| Parity | None |
| Stop Bits | 1 |
| Flow Control | None |

### MODBUS RTU

Modbus offers the most robust communication with the ASP nodes. A complete set of MODBUS registers can be found in the MODBUS Reference section.

<Callout kind="info" title="Data Logger Configuration">
  Refer to the data logger manufacturer's literature for instructions on how to configure the device using Modbus RTU.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="tip" title="Compatibility Check">
  To confirm compatibility with your data logger, please contact Osprey Measurement Systems.

### ASCII

The ASCII protocol offers a user-readable means of communicating with the ASP nodes, allowing the user to adjust common settings, take readings or troubleshoot the system using a laptop or Android mobile device.

  For more information on using the ASCII interface, please refer to the Serial USB Terminal user guide or RealTerm user guide.

## Data Conversion

The ASP nodes carry out onboard conversion of pressure to mm head. Change in elevation is relative to the reference sensor(s). To calculate the current elevation of a measurement node, the following calculations are used:

### Change in Relative Elevation

#### Fixed Reference Sensor

If the elevation of the reference sensor is assumed to be fixed:

```
Δeₙ = Δₙ - Δᵣ
```

**Where:**
- `Δeₙ` = change in relative elevation of a given node
- `Δₙ` = n₁ - n₀ = current reading at node n minus initial reading at node n
- `Δᵣ` = r₁ - r₀ = current reading at reference sensor, or the mean of readings from multiple reference sensors minus initial reference reading

#### Derived Reference

If the elevation of the reference is derived:

```
Δeₙ = Δₙ - Δᵣ + Δd
```

**Where:**
- `Δeₙ` = change in relative elevation of a given node
- `Δₙ` = n₁ - n₀ = current reading at node n minus initial reading at node n
- `Δᵣ` = r₁ - r₀ = current reading at reference sensor, or the mean of readings from multiple reference sensors minus the initial reading at the reference sensor(s)
- `Δd` = d₁ - d₀ = current reading of the external reference minus the initial reading

### Absolute Elevation

To calculate the absolute elevation of a measurement node:

```
Eₙ₁ = Δeₙ + Eₙ₀
```

**Where:**
- `Eₙ₁` = Current reduced level of a given node
- `Δeₙ` = change in relative elevation as described above
- `Eₙ₀` = Initial reduced level of node at time of installation

<Callout kind="tip" title="Calculation Example">
  Always record initial elevations (Eₙ₀) during installation and the baseline reading period to enable accurate absolute elevation calculations.
