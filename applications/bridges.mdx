description: Monitor bridge behavior during construction and operation, focusing on settlement, rotation, and deck movement with Osprey instrumentation.
---

## Overview

Bridge monitoring tracks how abutments, piers, and decks move and rotate over time so you can manage construction risks and long-term performance.

## Common monitoring goals

Bridge projects typically focus on a small set of critical behaviors:

- **Abutment and pier settlement** along foundations and approach embankments.
- **Rotation and tilt** of piers, abutments, and retaining structures supporting the deck.
- **Deck displacement and profile** changes along the length of the bridge.
- **Construction staging effects**, including load transfers, temporary works behavior, and responses to major construction events.

## Relevant Osprey products

Use these Osprey systems to measure the most common bridge behaviors.
