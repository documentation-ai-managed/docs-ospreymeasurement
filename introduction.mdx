## Overview

Osprey Measurement Systems provides advanced geotechnical and structural instrumentation for the civil and resources sectors. You get monitoring solutions that automate manual processes, reduce costs, and deliver precise data from challenging environments. Key products like the Osprey Tilt String (`OTS`) and In-Place Extensometer (`IPX`) enable distributed measurements for tilt, strain, and deformation in assets such as diaphragm walls, pipelines, railways, and retaining structures.
