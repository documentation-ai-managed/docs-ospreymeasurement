description: Monitoring ground and structural movement in industrial facilities using Osprey systems.

## Industrial applications

Industrial facilities such as plants, terminals, and processing sites often sit on complex ground conditions and include critical structures, buried services, and containment systems. Reliable movement monitoring helps you understand how these assets respond to loads, ground changes, and nearby construction so you can manage risk and plan maintenance.

## Common monitoring goals

Typical monitoring objectives in industrial environments include:

- Tracking settlement or heave beneath slabs, tanks, and equipment foundations
- Profiling deformation along buried pipelines, culverts, and service corridors
- Observing embankment and bund wall performance around storage or process areas
- Detecting movement along access roads, rail sidings, and conveyor corridors
- Supporting long-term performance assessment and maintenance planning
