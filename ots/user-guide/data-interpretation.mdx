description: Understanding Roll, Pitch, Yaw outputs and orientation measurements from OTS sensors
---

## Overview

For most applications, the Roll, Pitch, Yaw outputs should be sufficient.

**All outputs are in units of Radians.**

## Orientation

### Roll

**Device laid flat is at 0 radians.**

Looking along device from rear towards logger, clockwise is positive.

```
Flat Position: 0 radians
Clockwise Rotation: Positive values
Counterclockwise Rotation: Negative values
```

<Callout kind="info" title="Note">
  Roll measurements are meaningless in vertical applications.
</Callout>

### Pitch

**Device laid flat is 0 radians.**

Forward pitch is positive.

```
Flat Position: 0 radians
Forward Pitch: Positive values
Backward Pitch: Negative values
```

### Yaw

**Device pointing up is 0 radians.**

Looking onto the top of the lid, clockwise is positive.

```
Pointing Up: 0 radians
Clockwise Rotation: Positive values
Counterclockwise Rotation: Negative values
```

<Callout kind="info" title="Note">
  Yaw measurements are meaningless in horizontal applications.

## Rotations Around the Gravitational Vector

As this is a gravitational sensor, only two of these parameters are valid at any one time:

| Application Type | Valid Parameters | Meaningless Parameter |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Horizontal | Roll, Pitch | Yaw |
| Vertical | Pitch, Yaw | Roll |

### Understanding Gravitational Limitations

The OTS uses a triaxial accelerometer to measure orientation relative to gravity. This means:

- **In horizontal applications** (e.g., railway tracks, bridge decks): The sensor can measure tilt in two directions (Roll and Pitch), but cannot determine rotation around the vertical axis (Yaw) because this axis is aligned with gravity.

- **In vertical applications** (e.g., retaining walls, building facades): The sensor can measure tilt away from vertical in two directions (Pitch and Yaw), but cannot determine rotation around the vertical axis (Roll) because this axis is aligned with gravity.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Application-Specific Interpretation">
  Always consider your installation orientation when interpreting sensor data. Focus on the two valid parameters for your specific application type.
