description: Planning considerations for ASP installation including datum establishment and system protection

## Establishing a Datum

It is critical that the location of the reference sensor and the source of the datum is known at the design stage of the project. The ASP relies on one or more sensors to be at a known elevation – either fixed or derived.

### Fixed Datum

The ASP reference sensor(s) are placed in a location assumed to be fixed. This is most typically achieved by placing the reference sensor outside of the zone of influence of the monitored works.

Alternatively, a fixed reference position can be created on top of a pile or other supporting structure.

<Callout kind="alert" title="Shearing Considerations">
  When using a fixed position within the zone of expected settlement, special consideration should be given to protecting the ASP from shearing.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="alert" title="Verify Fixed References">
  It is important to continue monitoring references assumed to be fixed, either by level survey or other means to confirm a fixed elevation.
</Callout>

### Derived Datum

Derived datums are calculated by monitoring the position of the reference node(s) with another monitoring system such as a robotic total station or In-Place Extensometer. Any measured vertical displacement of the reference node(s) is applied to the measurement nodes as detailed in the Data Conversion section.

<Callout kind="info" title="Secondary System Performance">
  It is important to consider the measurement performance of the secondary system to ensure it meets the requirements of the project. Any reduction in accuracy or monitoring frequency of the secondary system will impact the performance of all sensors referenced to that system.
</Callout>

#### ASP-to-ASP Derived Datum

A derived datum can also be achieved by overlapping two or more ASPs. The measured elevation of measurement nodes of an ASP with a known reference position can be transferred to reference nodes of another "floating" ASP by mounting on a common concrete slab or by strapping the two systems together, ensuring the measurement nodes are aligned with the intended reference nodes.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Multiple ASP Strings">
  Where three or more ASPs are linked in a string as described above, it is recommended that a fixed datum is present at both ends of the profile.
</Callout>

## Protection of the ASP

The ASP is designed and built to be robust, with the construction environment in mind. However there are some sources of force that must be considered when planning the installation:

### Point Loading / Piercing

Where the host material for the ASP contains large aggregate, rocks or other large debris, the ASP should be protected to avoid point loading or piercing.

This can be achieved by installing within a trench backfilled with a clean fill such as sand or other filtered material, as described in the Installation section.

### Crushing

Crush resistance is reliant on the bedding and stiffness of the surrounding material.

<Callout kind="alert" title="Installation Depth">
  Ensure the ASP is installed at least 500mm deep and any disturbed material is properly compacted before operating plant over the ASP.
</Callout>

### Tensile Stress

The ASP has an elastic elongation capacity of **8%**. Where there may be high tensile stress caused by differential settlement over short distances, a secondary conduit is recommended to accommodate the elongation in the conduit, rather than the ASP.

### Permeation

The ASP hose is made of a medium density polyethylene (PE80) which has excellent liquid permeation resistance but is not designed to contain high gas pressures.

<Callout kind="info" title="High Pressure Environments">
  In applications where high pore-gas pressure is expected, the ASP should be installed within a secondary conduit.
</Callout>

Similarly, a secondary conduit can assist in contaminated soils containing chemicals to which MDPE offers unsatisfactory resistance.

### Seepage

The installation of the ASP – particularly when installed within a sand filled trench – can create a seepage path which may present issues where piezometers are installed nearby or in water retaining structures.

**Mitigation Options:**
- Use a bentonite/sand mix to mitigate water migration
- Install compacted bentonite plugs where 2m sections of the trench are backfilled with bentonite powder only

### Fire

<Callout kind="alert" title="Fire Risk">
  MDPE, which makes up the majority of the ASP's body, is fire enabling and therefore not suited to applications with high fire risk without appropriate measures being taken.
</Callout>
