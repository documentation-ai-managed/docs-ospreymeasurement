title: Osprey Tilt String (OTS)
description: Compact, factory-assembled bus of low power inclinometer sensors for structural monitoring
---

## Overview

The Osprey Measurement Systems Tilt String is a compact, factory-assembled bus of low power inclinometer sensors used for the measurement of structures at periodic locations. The system can be controlled and interrogated by an advanced serial API, or Modbus RTU interface.

Each sensor within the string contains a triaxial accelerometer, allowing the sensor to report its orientation with respect to gravity in any orientation. Changes in orientation is used to precisely monitor rotation of structures and can be extrapolated to model deformation profiles along a horizontal or vertical line, or around an existing curve.

## Key Features

- **Triaxial Accelerometer**: Each sensor reports orientation with respect to gravity in any orientation
- **Flexible Control**: Advanced serial API or Modbus RTU interface
- **Compact Design**: Factory-assembled for simple deployment
- **Low Power**: Efficient operation for long-term monitoring
- **Versatile Mounting**: Variety of mounting options, cabling media and array geometries
- **Deformation Profiling**: Model deformation profiles along horizontal, vertical, or curved lines

## Applications

The Osprey Tilt String is intended for use in heavy industrial and civil engineering applications where there is a need to understand the long term orientation of some structure with respect to gravity.
