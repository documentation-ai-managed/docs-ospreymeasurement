## MODBUS Register Map

The following table provides the complete MODBUS register map for the ASP system.

### Measurement Registers

| Register (Hex) | Register (Dec) | Description | Data Size | Units | Domain |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 0xFE | 254 | Pressure MSW | Float 2dp | Pa | 0 to 1,000,000 |
| 0xFF | 255 | Pressure LSW | Float 2dp | Pa | 0 to 1,000,000 |
| 0x100 | 256 | Distance MSW | Float 2dp | mm | -10,000 to +10,000 |
| 0x101 | 257 | Distance LSW | Float 2dp | mm | -10,000 to +10,000 |
| 0x102 | 258 | Voltage MSW | Float 2dp | V | 0 to 24 |
| 0x103 | 259 | Voltage LSW | Float 2dp | V | 0 to 24 |
| 0x104 | 260 | Temperature MSW | Float 2dp | °C | -20 to +60 |
| 0x105 | 261 | Temperature LSW | Float 2dp | °C | -20 to +60 |
| 0x117 | 279 | Measurement Status | Int16 | - | See status table |

<Callout kind="info" title="Float Data Type">
  Float values are stored in two consecutive 16-bit registers (MSW = Most Significant Word, LSW = Least Significant Word).
</Callout>

### Device Information Registers

| Register (Hex) | Register (Dec) | Description | Data Type |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| 0x200 | 512 | Alias / Bus Address | Uint16 |
| 0x201 | 513 | Product ID | String "AS" |
| 0x202 | 514 | Product ID | String "P\n" |
| 0x209 | 521 | Serial Number MSW | Uint32 |
| 0x20A | 522 | Serial Number LSW | Uint32 |
| 0x20B | 523 | Software Rev MSW | Uint32 |
| 0x20C | 524 | Software Rev LSW | Uint32 |
| 0x20D | 525 | Hardware Rev MSW | Uint32 |
| 0x20E | 526 | Hardware Rev LSW | Uint32 |

## Measurement Status Codes

The Measurement Status register (0x117 / 279) provides information about the current state of the sensor measurement.

| Status Byte | Osprey Error Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0 | N/A | Measurement OK |
| 1 | -99 | Measurement Not Ready |
| 2 | -98 | Pressure value outside threshold |
| 3 | -97 | Sensor reports an internal error |
| 4 | -96 | Insufficient power |

### Status Code Descriptions

#### Status 0 - Measurement OK
The sensor is functioning normally and the measurement is valid.

#### Status 1 - Measurement Not Ready
The sensor is in the process of taking a measurement. Wait and retry.

#### Status 2 - Pressure Value Outside Threshold
The measured pressure is outside the expected operating range. This may indicate:
- Sensor is not properly installed
- System has been damaged
- Extreme environmental conditions

#### Status 3 - Sensor Internal Error
The sensor has detected an internal fault. Contact Osprey Measurement Systems for support.

#### Status 4 - Insufficient Power
The supply voltage is below the minimum operating threshold. Check:
- Power supply voltage (should be 8-18V)
- Cable connections
- Total power draw on the bus

<Callout kind="alert" title="Error Handling">
  If you consistently receive error codes 2, 3, or 4, stop data collection and contact Osprey Measurement Systems support for assistance.
</Callout>

## Reading MODBUS Registers

### Example: Reading Distance

To read the distance measurement:

1. Read registers 0x100 (256) and 0x101 (257)
2. Combine MSW and LSW to form a 32-bit float value
3. The result is the distance in millimeters

### Example: Reading Temperature

To read the temperature measurement:

1. Read registers 0x104 (260) and 0x105 (261)
2. Combine MSW and LSW to form a 32-bit float value
3. The result is the temperature in degrees Celsius

<Callout kind="tip" title="Data Logger Integration">
  Most industrial data loggers with MODBUS RTU support can automatically handle 32-bit float reads from consecutive registers. Refer to your data logger's documentation for specific configuration instructions.
