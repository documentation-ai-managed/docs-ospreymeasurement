title: In-Place Extensometer (IPX)
description: Magnetic-field sensitive probe for automated monitoring of magnetic extensometers
---

## Overview

The Osprey Measurement Systems In-Place Extensometer is a magnetic-field sensitive probe designed for use in conjunction with standard magnetic extensometer installations. The system automates the monitoring of magnetic extensometers to provide real time data.

The system comprises a stainless-steel bottom and top support, a continuous GRP support rod, and one or more in-place extensometer sensors, cable and a data logger. The sensors are secured onto the support rod using four grub screws. Each sensor is connected to the adjacent sensor by a four-core cable making up an RS-485 serial bus.

## Key Features

- **Automated Monitoring**: Real-time data collection from magnetic extensometers
- **Robust Construction**: Stainless-steel supports with continuous GRP support rod
- **RS-485 Serial Bus**: Reliable sensor communication via four-core cable
- **Flexible Configuration**: One or more sensors can be installed per system
- **Easy Maintenance**: Extensible design allows for installation adjustment
- **Compatible**: Works with standard borehole magnetic extensometer installations

## Applications

The In-Place Extensometer is optimised for use in standard borehole magnetic extensometer installations, including the common requirement to extend or shorten installations. They are also well suited to up-hole installations for tunnelling applications.

Applications include:

- Embankments
- Cuttings
- Stockpiles
- Deep excavations
- Tunnel subsidence from surface
- Convergence and subsidence monitored from within a tunnel
- Slopes
- Deep foundations

## Limitations

<Callout kind="alert" title="EMF Interference">
  The In-Place Extensometer should not be used near high EMF generators such as underground power transmission lines, substations or large generators. Where it is used near ferrous materials such as ore bodies or reinforcement cages, function should be verified in-situ.
