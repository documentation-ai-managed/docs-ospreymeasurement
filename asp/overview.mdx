title: Automatic Settlement Profiler (ASP)
description: Distributed settlement measurements along a nominally horizontal profile using hydrostatic principle
---

## Overview

The Automatic Settlement Profiler (ASP) provides distributed settlement measurements along a nominally horizontal profile. It comprises a fluid filled MDPE hose containing pressure sensors (nodes) at set intervals. Stainless steel end caps retain the fluid and a high-pressure cable gland provides cable entry for communication with the nodes.

## How It Works

The ASP operates on the **hydrostatic principle** that pressure within a continuous body of fluid at rest will increase proportional to depth. By creating a continuous body of fluid of a known density, a series of pressure sensing nodes within the system can precisely report their elevation with respect to other nodes within the system.

The principle relies on knowledge of the density of the fluid to convert pressure to elevation. As density changes with temperature, the nodes are equipped with temperature sensors to allow on-board calibration and conversion of pressure to millimeters.

<Callout kind="info" title="Relative Measurements">
  The elevation measurements reported by the nodes are relative only and do not in and of themselves provide any meaningful information. A node (or nodes) at a known or knowable elevation is used as a reference for all other sensors, the difference in reading indicating the variance in elevation from the reference node to the measurement node.

## Key Features

- **Hydrostatic Principle**: Precise elevation measurements using fluid pressure
- **Distributed Sensing**: Multiple pressure sensors along the profile
- **Temperature Compensation**: On-board temperature sensors for accurate conversion
- **Pre-filled System**: Arrives fully filled, de-aired and sealed
- **Robust Construction**: MDPE hose with stainless steel end caps
- **Easy Installation**: Can be installed in trenches, direct burial, or conduits
- **RS485 Communication**: MODBUS RTU and ASCII protocols supported

## Applications

The Automatic Settlement Profiler is optimized for use in bulk earthworks projects, buried within a trench. They are also well suited to structural applications where exposure to temperature differentials can be minimized, such as basements, tunnels or foundations.

Applications include:

- Embankments
- Stockpiles
- Tunnel subsidence from surface
- Slope/Cutting Stability
- Bridges
- Basements

## Limitations

<Callout kind="alert" title="Temperature Considerations">
  It is important that temperature variation across the system is kept to a minimum as the pressure on each node is affected by the entire column of fluid above it, not just the fluid proximate to the sensor. Temperature variation across the system will result in reduced system performance.
