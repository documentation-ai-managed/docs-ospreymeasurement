description: Application guide for using Osprey systems to monitor rail infrastructure.
---

## Overview

Rail infrastructure is sensitive to ground movement, settlement, and structural deformation along the track and at associated earthworks, bridges, and tunnels. Osprey systems can be combined to monitor rail corridors and critical assets so you can detect change, correlate it with site activities or environmental conditions, and support maintenance and safety decisions.

## Common monitoring goals

Use Osprey systems on rail projects to help you:

- Track vertical settlement along track alignments, embankments, and cuttings
- Measure rotation and bending of structures such as bridges, retaining walls, and platforms
- Monitor displacement along trackside or tunnel extensometers
- Observe how construction activities or nearby excavation influence track geometry
- Support validation of design assumptions for new or upgraded rail assets
- Provide evidence for maintenance planning and operational risk management

<Card title="OTS" href="/ots/overview" icon="gauge">

OTS measures orientation and rotation using triaxial accelerometer inclinometer sensors, and can be used to model deformation profiles along a horizontal or vertical line or curve.

<Card title="ASP" href="/asp/overview" icon="droplets">

ASP provides distributed settlement measurements along a nominally horizontal profile using the hydrostatic principle, with pressure nodes in a fluid-filled hose and temperature compensation.

IPX automates monitoring of standard magnetic extensometer installations over an RS-485 serial bus to measure displacement along a line.
